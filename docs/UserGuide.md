this is you, then ModuleBook3.5 is the right fit for you.

ModuleBook3.5 is the go-to tool for busy students/professionals who are confident that typing can save them time. 
Using ModuleBook3.5, one can organise and keep track of tasks and their deadlines without the need for consistent 
internet connection.

## Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the compulsory parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/DESCRIPTION`.

* For `MODULE`, the letters in module code should be upper-case.<br>
  e.g. `CS2103T` and not `cs2103t`.
  
* For `START TIME` and `DEADLINE`, the accepted date-time formats are: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm or yyyy-MM-dd (HH:mm taken as current time).<br>
  e.g. `2021-03-21 10:10` or `2021-03-21`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `d/DESCRIPTION [t/TAG]` can be used as `d/CS3243 Assignment4 t/Minimax` or as `d/CS3243 Assignment4`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Minimax`, `t/Minimax t/CSP` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION t/TAG`, `t/TAG d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `d/CS2103T team project for week7 d/CS3243 Assignment 4`, only `d/CS2103T team project for week7` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as`list`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

## FAQ
**Q**: I tried double-clicking the jar file but it did not open. What happened?<br>
**A**: Try checking if any security software is blocking the jar file. If that still does not work, navigate to command prompt and run the following command:
`java -jar modulebook.jar`

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ModuleBook3.5 home folder.
